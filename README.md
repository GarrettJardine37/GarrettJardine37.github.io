# HangMan
This is a MERN fullstack web application designed to allow you to play hang man in your browser. We populated the database using a free online word api. After creating an account, a word is randomly seleceted from the database and the player is presented with the game UI in which they play hangman. After winning, the player's score is saved and they are shown a high scores screen. This app uses React for the frontend and mongo dB for the backend
